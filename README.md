Genealogical tree

=================
My final project of my degree: an application that lets you create a genealogical tree converting GEDCOM files into a Neo4j structure. The app is built using AngularJS, Node.js and Express, and the first steps are based in conceptual-chains by James H. Edwards.
=================


To test it:
1) Clone the project  
2) cd genealogical-tree
3) npm install
4) start the Neo4j server  
5) Enjoy it!
